**Plant Identification using Transfer Learning**

---

## Overview

This project aims to utilize transfer learning techniques to develop a plant identification system. Transfer learning involves leveraging pre-trained models to solve related tasks, reducing the need for large datasets and computational resources. In this project, we'll build upon a pre-trained neural network model to recognize different plant species from images.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Gather a dataset containing images of various plant species. Ensure the dataset is labeled correctly.
   - Organize the dataset into appropriate directories (e.g., train, validation, test) for training the model.

2. **Model Training:**
   - Run the training script, providing the path to the dataset.
   ```bash
   python train.py --data_path /path/to/dataset
   ```

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the trained model's performance on a separate test dataset.
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/trained/model --test_data_path /path/to/test/dataset
   ```

4. **Inference:**
   - Use the trained model for inference on new images.
   ```bash
   python predict.py --model_path /path/to/trained/model --image_path /path/to/image
   ```

## Model Architecture

The model architecture used in this project is based on a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), such as VGG16, ResNet, or Inception. We replace the top layers of the pre-trained model with custom fully connected layers and train it on our specific dataset.
